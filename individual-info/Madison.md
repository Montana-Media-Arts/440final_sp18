## Basic Info

Title: Live Mario

Length: ~2min


## Description
Live Mario explores notions of reality and fantasy by merging live character performance with a virtual video game. The game tracks the area directly in front of a projector screen and feeds that information back into the game. This allows flesh and blood entities to play the game as if they were a virtual character.


## Tech Info

Lighting: ambient light in the room. No spotlight on the screen please (too much light will make the projection hard for the camera to read). However, a spotlight when I am sitting off to the side would be great

Sound: Stero output via 3mm jack. No microphone.

Projector/Screen: I can use the provided screen, but I need the base of the projection to extend to the floor and the top to extend about 2ft above head height (~8ft)

Stage: One actor will exist on stage, jumping around in front of the screen. I need a clear stage area and will be setting up my webcam on a tripod about 4ft off the ground somewhere on stage

Other Tech Needs: a chair
