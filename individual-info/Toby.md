## Description

Using Max for Live and Ableton to track a color that will change the velocity and
pitch of sounds in Ableton. I want to use my guitar but might just use virtual instruments
depending on what works.

## Tech Info

Lighting: Dark enough that other light won't mess with color tracker

Sound: Focusrite (2 x 1/4") to monitors

Projector/Screen: Might not use projector for this. Just sound.

Stage: I think I'll use someone else to move in front of the webcam so I can focus on playing.
So they will be on the stage.
