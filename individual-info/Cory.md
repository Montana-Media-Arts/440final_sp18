Length: 3-4 Minutes?


## Description

An interactive audio-visual projection mapping performance with a controller made of conductive proximity sensors.  

## Tech Info

Lighting: Minimal lighting, need the projections to be bright on a white surface.

Sound: Will be playing midi based clips from Ableton Live off of a laptop- or any computer provided with Ableton Live 10. Will need an audio interface to connect to my laptop so that the audio is better quality than line-in. 

Projector/Screen: Using my own surface as a screen, and a projector stand to overhead project. Will also need a cameraman to broadcast performance onto main screen for better audience view.

Stage: I will be performing on a table, which will act as my instrument and the screen for the audience. Projection will not be audience-friendly, so I may need a cameraman to follow the performance.

Other Tech Needs: Will
