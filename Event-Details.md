Please join the Montana Interactive Arts Lab for an evening of installations and performances. From 6:00pm to 6:50pm and from 8:30pm to 9:00pm, Grant Ligo, Amie Shae, Riley Woods - "Inheritance", and Laura Lovo - "Point of View" will each have installations open for the general public. These will be located throughout McGill Hall. These installations explore interactive virtual reality, immersive experiences, and poetry.

At 7:00pm, students from Michael Musick's "Interactive Arts 2" class (MART440) will present a show of interactive performance works developed, created, or composed by themselves. These pieces will include interactive music systems, short theatrical sketches, projection mapping, dance, and comedy. This show will last approximately until 8:30pm, and will take place in the Production Studio of McGill Hall.
