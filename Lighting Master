(Note: we need light shining directly on podium surface?)

Abby: Just Inkys 
Garrett Gredell: Just Inkys, no lighting change
Delaney: front/side lighting
Stone: podium lights 
Sierra: Podium Lights
Cory: Minimal lighting, need the q to be bright on a white surface.
Madison: ambient light in the room. No spotlight on the screen please 
            (too much light will make the projection hard for the camera to read). 
             However, a spotlight when I am sitting off to the side would be great
Toby: Spotlight on him
Ryan: Podium lights + stage lights
Mackenzie: NO LIGHTING
Anna Hill: Stage Lights
Emily: Ambient Lighting (maybe both Inkys?)
Nic: ???
Chistopher: No shadows of a preson figure behind the actor. (?)
