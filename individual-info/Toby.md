## Description

Color tracking with Max for Live and Ableton. Not sure if I'll be using my guitar or built in virtual instruments, but the color will be manipulating the velocity and pitch of whatever is running in Ableton.

## Tech Info

Lighting: dark enough for color to be picked up by webcam without interference.

Sound: I'll likely just hook up my Focusrite to the monitors ( 2 x 1/4")

Projector/Screen: Might not use projector for this, will be focused on sound.

Stage: I'm thinking about using someone else to hold the light/color I'll be tracking. If I do that, they would be "on stage."
