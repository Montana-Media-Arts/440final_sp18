## Basic Info

Title: Fair Use

Length: 3-4 Minutes?


## Description

An interactive audio-visual performance using projection mapping and conductive sensors. Will ideally be an abstract soundscape or 'song' which is played by touching projected video clips, and will focus on the unclear boundaries artists face when reappropriating, sampling, and copying the work of others- primarily in digital forms. I will be taking advantage of the fact that I am a student and have more leniency when stealing these samples in an academic, non-commercial way.


## Tech Info

Lighting: Minimal lighting, need the projections to be bright on a white surface.

Sound: Will be playing midi based clips from Ableton Live off of a laptop- or any computer provided with Ableton Live 10. Will need an audio interface to connect to my laptop so that the audio is better quality than line-in. 

Projector/Screen: Need an overhead projector to cast downward onto a table.

Stage: I will be performing on a table, which will act as my instrument and the screen for the audience. The audience is welcome to stand around the table to get a better view of the visuals. Might need to incorporate a slant to the table so that it is angled toward the audience slightly.

Other Tech Needs: Will be working with projection mapping through midi interfaces, VPT, Ableton Live, Max 7.
