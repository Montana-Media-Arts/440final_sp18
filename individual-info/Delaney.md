## Basic Info

Title: 1 V 1

Length: At least 1:30
(depends upon the fighting)


## Description
-Two actors (my Belegarth buddies) will have foam weapons and be in garb (bitchin' belegarth clothes) 
-i will be controlling the background from my laptop, with key commands
-We'll do three rounds, each hit will trigger me to trigger a background change until one is defeated, in which case a KO screen will come up and the next round will reset.



## Tech Info

Lighting: front/side lighting. 
(with the goal of illuminating the two actors, without producing shadows that mess with the background)

Sound: Street fighter style music, sound effects. Not the most important part of the performance, but should be loud enough for the audience to hear. (Plugging into my laptop will work just fine.)

Projector/Screen:
Rear projector, background that I will control (probably with key commands)

Stage: Enough room for two people to fight with foam weapons.

Other Tech Needs:
I'll bring the foam weapons.
