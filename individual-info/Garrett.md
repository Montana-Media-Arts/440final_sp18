## Basic Info

Title: A Rockin' Story

Length: 1-2 Mins


## Description 
Using Adobe animate, a guitar, and terrible voice acting, I would like to tell a story that incorporates humor and musical effects.


## Tech Info
I need a projection, speakers, a guitar cable, and an amp. I have an amp and guitar cables though
Lighting:

Sound: Voice and Instrument, ideally through seperate channels

Projector/Screen: Just need to project my animated character

Stage:I would prefer to be hidden to give the effect that the character exists on his own without me. Not a ventriloquist performance

Other Tech Needs: I can't think of any.
