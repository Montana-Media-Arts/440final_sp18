(Note: we need light shining directly on podium surface?)

Abby: Podium Light
Garrett Gredell: Podium Lights
Delaney: front/side lighting. (with the goal of illuminating the two actors, without producing shadows that mess with the background)
Stone: Lighting on the board (?)
Sierra: Podium Lights
Cory: Minimal lighting, need the projections to be bright on a white surface.
Madison: ambient light in the room. No spotlight on the screen please 
            (too much light will make the projection hard for the camera to read). 
             However, a spotlight when I am sitting off to the side would be great
Toby: Spotlight on him
Ryan: Podium lights 
Mackenzie: NO LIGHTING
Anna Hill: Stage Lights
Emily: Ambient Lighting (maybe both Inkys?)
Nic: ???
Chistopher: No shadows of a preson figure behind the actor. (?)
